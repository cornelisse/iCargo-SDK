# Semantic tooling

The term tooling is used here as a synonym for applications or web-services to be used offline for the creation and maintenance of descriptions. These descriptions can vary from semantic models to system configurations. The term semantic tooling implies the involvement of a semantic model and the use of ontologies to describe concepts. The following activities require support of semantic tooling:

* Constructing a semantic model
* Configuration of an Access Point
* Configuration of a peer-to-peer connection
* ...

## Constructing a semantic model

(To do ...)

## Configuration of an Access Point

(To do ...)

## Configuration of a peer-to-peer connection

The configuration of a specific P2P connection is stored as a [Cooperation Agreement](link.md) and requires an invitation process as described [here](link.md). 

To support the invitation process and the construction of a Cooperation Agreement, means that two users both have a tool which is able to exchange information with each other. This requires a dedicated but open interface specification. Fortunately, such an open specification is available as a subset of the iCargo REST interface.

A generic but limited implementation of a connection configuration tool can be found [here](tools/connect.html)
